## Setup

To set up the font faces:

- Copy the `volter` directory into your project.
- Import `volter/volter.css` in any CSS file you wish to use it in.

Then you can start using the font faces, e.g.:

```scss
@import url("volter/volter.css");

// Volter (Goldfish)
span.volter {
  font-family: 'Volter';
}

// Volter-Bold (Goldfish)
span.volter-bold {
  font-family: 'Volter';
  font-weight: bold;
}
```
